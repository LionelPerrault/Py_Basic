# Tuples

## Tuples are immutable ordered collections of elements that can be of different data types.

## A tuple can be indexed, sliced and iterated over.

# Declaring an empty tuple
empty_tuple = ()

# Declaring a tuple using the built-in `tuple()` function
empty_tuple_ = tuple()

# Declaring a tuple with elements of different data types
mixed_data_types_tuple = (1, 2, 3.5, "wow")

# A tuple can be declared very simply without brackets
tuple_ = 1, 2, 3

print("The type of the tuple is:", type(tuple_))
